# Ancestral Vision: Product Pitch

## The Problem

Traditional genealogy platforms like Ancestry.com, FamilySearch, and MyHeritage have digitized family history research, but they've done so by replicating the paper-based paradigm: flat trees, form fields, and databases of records. For many users, this approach feels:

- **Overwhelming**: Too many fields, too much data to enter
- **Sterile**: Names and dates without emotional connection
- **Isolating**: Individual research without community
- **Incomplete**: Dead ends where records don't exist
- **Forgettable**: No reason to return once the tree is built

## The Solution

**For people who want to preserve and explore their family heritage**, Ancestral Vision is a genealogy platform that turns your family history into an immersive 3D experience.

### What Makes Us Different

#### 1. Visualizes Your Family as a Navigable Constellation
Fly through your ancestry like exploring a star system. Each person is a celestial body whose size and brightness reflect the richness of their story. Watch connections flow as luminous threads between generations.

#### 2. Rewards Engagement Through Gamification
Your constellation grows more vibrant as you add memories and stories. Empty profiles are dim, distant stars. Rich biographies become brilliant, pulsing planets surrounded by satellites of events and media.

#### 3. Focuses on Stories, Not Just Data
Every person becomes rich with notes, events, audio recordings, and media. The platform encourages narrative over data entry: "Tell me about grandma" instead of "Enter birth date."

#### 4. Uses AI to Help You Discover
Our AI analyzes your notes and recordings to suggest new people, events, and connections. Upload an interview recording and watch as the AI extracts names, relationships, and life events to add to your constellation.

#### 5. Speculates Into the Unknown
Don't have records for your great-great-grandparents? Our AI can generate plausible ancestors based on historical context and known relatives. These "speculative" ancestors are clearly marked and can be confirmed as you discover more.

#### 6. Connects You With Others
Match relatives with other users' trees to discover shared history and inherited memories. See notes and events that distant cousins have added to your shared ancestors.

#### 7. Creates Displayable Art
Your constellation can be displayed as living art in a digital frame at home. Watch your ancestry slowly rotate and pulse, a constant reminder of where you came from.
